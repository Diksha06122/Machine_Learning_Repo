## Car Price Prediction - Linear Regression

### Project Description

This project focuses on predicting car prices using a Linear Regression model. The goal is to estimate the price of a car based on various features such as mileage, make, model, year, and other relevant attributes.

### Key Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis, handling missing values, and feature engineering.
2. **Model Training**: Building and training the Linear Regression model on the training dataset.
3. **Evaluation**: Evaluating the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
4. **Prediction**: Using the trained model to make predictions on new data.

## Breast Cancer Prediction - KNN

### Project Description

This project aims to classify breast cancer as benign or malignant using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The dataset used is the well-known Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.


### Key Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning the dataset, normalizing features, and splitting into training and testing sets.
2. **Model Training**: Building and training the KNN model on the training dataset.
3. **Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
4. **Prediction**: Applying the trained model to predict the class of new samples.


## MNIST Digit Classification - KNN

### Project Description

This project involves classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The MNIST dataset is a benchmark dataset in machine learning for image classification.

### Key Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Loading and normalizing the MNIST dataset, and splitting it into training and testing sets.
2. **Model Training**: Building and training the KNN model on the training dataset.
3. **Evaluation**: Evaluating the model's performance using accuracy and confusion matrix.
4. **Prediction**: Using the trained model to classify new handwritten digit images.
